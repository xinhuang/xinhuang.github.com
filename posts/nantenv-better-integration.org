* Use NAnt by NAnt plugin of Jenkins

  As a popular CI tool, Jenkins [fn:Jenkins] is widely used in many places. NAnt [fn:NAnt] is a popular .NET build tool. If you are using NAnt with Jenkins, you should have been using NAnt plugins [fn:NAnt-Plugin].

* 2 ways to load build parameters

  To pass build parameters to NAnt script, usually there are 2 ways to achieve it:

** Pass by property through NAnt plugin

   After adding a NAnt build step, click the "Advanced" button, a panel will show up.
   You can fill desired NAnt properties inside; if you need to access build parameters, you can use =$BUILD_PARAM=.

** Load property from environment variable

   Jenkins will set environment variable according to given build parameters. So you can query them inside NAnt scripts:

   #+BEGIN_SRC xml
   <if test="${environment::variable-exists('VAR_NAME')}">
     <property name="var.name" value="${environment::get-variable('VAR_NAME')}"/>
   </if>
   #+END_SRC

   This is handy. Adding 1 configuration parameter just needs to *copy* above 3 lines.

   But soon you will find these 3 similar lines scatterring every where. 
   Especially when your NAnt scripts share lots of common logic, you want to extract all these setting up code into a =common.include=.
   Months later, you realize it becomes a monster with hundreds of these "test-then-set" lines.

* Convention over configuration

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Ctrl+c Ctrl+v is the root of every evil.  
  #+END_QUOTE

  In our build script, we have following conventions:

  1. All Jenkins build parameters are in uppercase, separated by underscore, e.g.:  
     =FULL_ENSEMBLE_REGISTRATION=.
  2. All NAnt script variables are in lowercase, separated by dot, e.g.:  
     =full.ensemble.registration=.

  When pass build parameters, we load it from environment variables in NAnt scripts. What it does is transforming the uppercase form into the lowercase form.

  This gives us opportunities to eliminate those duplications: let NAnt task do the transformation, without breaking existing code or current script guidelines.

** Load environment variables into NAnt properties

   Here is the LoadEnvTask project. [fn:LoadEnvTask] To use it, call =load-environment= task in your NAnt script:

   #+BEGIN_SRC xml
   <target name="MyTarget">
     <load-environment verbose="true"/>

     <echo message="my.var loaded from environment variable: ${my.var}"/>
   </target>
   #+END_SRC

   And you will see from the log:

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   systemdrive = C:  

   programw6432 = C:\Program Files  

   ...  

   my.var = some value  
   #+END_QUOTE

   There are other options like specifying which =delimeter= -s to replace, whether to convert everything =tolower=, from which =target=, =process=, =user= or =machine=, to load environment variables.

   Although all environment variables will be loaded into NAnt properties, and many of them are useless. But usually there is no confliction, so I didn't add a filter to it. (If you need, PRs are welcome.)
