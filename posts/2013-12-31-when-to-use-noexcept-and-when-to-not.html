                <p>In C++ 11, a new keyword <code>noexcept</code> is introduced. Being a replacement of deprecated <code>throw()</code>, what is <code>noexcept</code> good for? When should it be used and when should be avoided?</p>
<h2 id="intro-to-noexcept">Intro to noexcept</h2>
<p><code>noexcept</code> is a function specifier. It is used to specify a function whether will throw exception or not. It can be used as following:</p>
<pre><code>void foo() noexcept;             // a function specified as will never throw
void foo2() noexcept(true);      // same as foo
void bar();                      // a function might throw exception
void bar2() noexcept(false);     // same as bar
</code></pre><p>However, same as <code>throw()</code>, <em><code>noexcept</code> implies no compile-time check</em>. What if a function specified with <code>noexcept</code> throws an exception?</p>
<p>Unlike <code>throw()</code>, if an exception is thrown out of a <code>noexcept</code> function, <code>std::unexpected</code> will not be called. Stack unwinding, during which destructor of stack allocated objects will be called, is <em>not guaranteed</em>. But <code>std::terminated</code> will be called immediately.</p>
<p><code>noexcept</code> is to provide information for compiler, allow it to generate optimized code against non-throwing functions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Great, &quot;noexcept&quot; means more optimized code. Let&#39;s use it as much as we can!</p>
<p>- DON&#39;T!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exception-free code is one of the hardest thing to do right. If you don&#39;t believe me, check out <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1853243/c-do-you-really-write-exception-safe-code">this question</a> on StackOverflow. Even though the function is simple at first, marking it <code>noexcept</code> will make it difficult to change in the future, or break existing client code if changed.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see an interesting example.</p>
<h2 id="noexcept-and-std-vector">noexcept and std::vector</h2>
<p>As you might have known, a <code>vector</code> has its capacity. If it&#39;s full when <code>push_back</code>, it will allocate a bigger memory, copy (or move if C++ 11) all existing elements to the new trunk, then add the new element to the back.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/when-to-use-noexcept-and-when-to-not/copy-construct.png" alt="Use copy constructor to expand a vector"></p>
<p>But what if an exception is thrown out while allocating memory, or copying the element to the new trunk?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If exception is thrown during allocating memory, the vector is in its original state. It&#39;s fine just re-throw the exception and let user handle it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If exception is thrown during copy existing elements, all copied elements will be destroyed by calling destructor, allocated trunk will be freed, and exception thrown out to be handle by user code. (1)<br>After destroy everything, the vector is back to the original state. Now it&#39;s safe to throw exception to let user handle it, without leaking any resource.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="noexcept-and-move">noexcept and move</h3>
<p>Come to the era of C++ 11, we have a powerful weapon called <code>move</code>. It allows us to steal resources from unused objects. std::vector will use <code>move</code> when it needs to increase(or decrease) the capacity, <em>as long as</em> the <code>move</code> operation is <strong>noexcept</strong>.</p>
<p>Suppose an exception throws during the move, the previous trunk is not the same as before <code>move</code> happens: resources are stolen, leaving the vector in an <em>broken</em> state. User cannot handle the exception because everything is in an nondeterministic state.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/when-to-use-noexcept-and-when-to-not/move-construct.png" alt="Use move constructor to expand a vector"></p>
<p>That&#39;s why <code>std::vector</code> relies on <code>move constructor</code> to be <strong>noexcept</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a demostration how client code would rely on <code>noexcept</code> as an interface specification. If later the <code>noexcept</code> requirement is not met, any code previously depends on it will be broken.</p>
<h2 id="noexcept-is-an-interface-specification">noexcept is an interface specification</h2>
<p>It&#39;s easy to add <code>noexcept</code> in the begining, but it will be difficult to modify the interface, or remove <code>noexcept</code>.</p>
<p>Just like other interface specifications, the principle of when and how to use <code>noexcept</code> should be carefully considered, but in general:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When define an interface, parameter type should be as specific as
possible, and return type should be as specific as possible, so future
modification can be made easily.   </p>
<p>The <code>noexcept</code> specification should also be as <em>generic</em> as possible,
i.e. <code>noexcept(false)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(1) What if an exception is thrown during destroying copied elements?<br>    <code>std::terminated</code> will be called to terminate the program.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/An-Effective-Cpp11-14-Sampler">An Effective C++11/14 Sampler</a>, Scott Meyers talked about <code>noexcept</code> with above example. It&#39;s worth watching.</p>
