<i>The DIRECT TV "Get Rid Of Cable" commercial is a very interesting commercial. If you haven't watch it yet, you can watch the full commercial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ80SVOHKoo">here</a>. It starts by a simple thing, then it leads to complete a different story "<b>convincingly</b>" and "<b>reasonably</b>".</i>
</p>

<p>
Here is what will happen when your developers are forced to reach 100% test coverage:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When developers are forced to write unit tests, they write shit tests which test nothing.</li>

<li>When people write shit tests, their tests depend on the implementation.</li>

<li>When the tests depend on the implementation, production code is difficult to change.</li>

<li>When production code is difficult to change and you change it, you break tests.</li>

<li>When you break tests, you fix tests.</li>

<li>When you find the tests are shit tests, you want to delete them.</li>

<li>If you delete tests, test coverage drops.</li>

<li>If test coverage drops, everyone is blaming you.</li>

<li>If you cannot delete broken shit tests and have to fix them, you get pissed off.</li>

<li>Don't get pissed off, teach people why and how to write tests from the beginning.</li>

<li>And most importantly, don't force people to write unit tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You would say: <b>That is not true. By forcing people writing tests to reach test coverage of N%, (N is usually around 80 hopefully) they will carefully design their code so that it is unit-testable/testable.</b>
</p>

<p>
Once I had the same belief, until I came across a code snippet looked like below:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-csharp">[TestMethod]
<span class="org-keyword">public</span> <span class="org-type">void</span> DrawGauge_Test()
{
        <span class="org-keyword">using</span> (ShimsContext.<span class="org-function-name">Create</span>())
        {
        <span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">privateTestObj</span> = SetupTestObject();
        <span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">e</span> = <span class="org-keyword">new</span> <span class="org-type">PaintEventArgs</span>(g, clipRect);

        privateTestObj.<span class="org-function-name">SetField</span>(<span class="org-string">"m_pDomainIconIsSmall"</span>, BmpIconSmall)
        DrawGauge();
    }
    <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">If no exception, everything is OK</span>
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Let me explain:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>privateTestObj</code> is the SUT (System Under Test).</li>
<li><code>privateTestObj</code> is inherited from a type provided by the SDK. It overrides several methods, and these methods are used only by the <code>DrawGauge()</code>.</li>
<li>By calling <code>DrawGauge()</code> in the test, the override methods are considered "<b>covered</b>".</li>
</ol>

<p>
This test brings no value, but only maintenance burden. For a better design, the code should first setting up appropriate condition,  calling the override methods, and asserting correct values are returned (or side effect happened). Calling the `DrawGauge()` method and assert there is no exception is like cheating. The reason I was tripped over by the test is that I renamed the variable name accessed using reflection, but not because it actually found anything wrong.
</p>

<p>
Before your developers are ready, please don't force them to write tests aiming for N% test coverage. Unless they are willing to write tests - usually that is the time stakeholders start to ask questions like "Do we really have to write tests now? Can we do it later? Maybe tomorrow?" (Teach your stakeholders, too!)
</p>

<p>
For the God's sake, don't force people to write unit tests.
