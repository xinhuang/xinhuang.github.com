# About Me

Hi, there! My name is Xin Huang. Welcome to my blog.

I'm a software engineer, and working with C++ a lot.

Starting to contribute to Clang community in my spare time.

I am a programming multilingual. (Used to be fluent in PowerShell, but hate it.)

Here is my [resume]\|[pdf version]\|[LinkedIn]\|[GitHub]\|[StackOverflow].
