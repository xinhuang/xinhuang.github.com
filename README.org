#+TITLE: README

Hey. This is the source code of my website.

It is re-written in Emacs org mode. Pages are generated using org-export with some homebrewed elisp scripts.

It is still under construction.

-----

*Why am I re-writing this? Is it fun?*

Not too much. I am re-writing this because of updates of *nodejs* modules, suddenly my code doesn't work any more.
Maybe this is another reason for [[https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript][The Birth & *Death* of JavaScript]].
