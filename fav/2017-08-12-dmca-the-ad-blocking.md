You probably are using an ad-blocking browser plugin, e.g. Adblock, Adblock
Plus or uBlock. There are filter lists inside every plugin to tell which domain
or URL pattern gives ad and should be blocked.

There is a funny thing: [EasyList], one of the commonly used filter list,
receives a DMCA request to [remove a domain], _functionalclam.com_, so that it
will not be blocked when using [EasyList].

To better understand the **paradox**:

> Seems to me we just received a DMCA letter to alter our Firewall Rules.  
> Malware sites issuing DMCA letters to Anti-virus and Web-protect sites (like Google) to have their domains removed from firewall blocking.
