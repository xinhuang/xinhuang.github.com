* TODO The Short Answer

  1. Add =LATEX_HEADER=: =\usepackage[style=ieee,backend=bibtex]{biblatex}= to use =biblatex=
  2. Add =LATEX_HEADER=: =\addbibresource{ref.bib}=
  3. Add =\printbibliography= to where you would like references to be printed out
  4. Set =org-latex-pdf-process= as

     #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (setq org-latex-pdf-process
	   '(
	     "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
	     "bibtex %b"
	     "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
	     "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
	     "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))

  *For style*:
  - =IEEE= style: Install =biblatex-ieee=

* Some Myth

  Use =bibtex= result in error =bibtex.sty= not found
  Probably because of mising some style.

  =biber= didn't try.
