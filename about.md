# About Me

Hi! My name is Xin Huang. Welcome to my blog. 

I'm a software engineer, and a C++ fan. 
Starting to contribute to clang in my spare time.

I can speak in many programming languages. I'm fluent in PowerShell, but hate it.

Currently I'm looking for a software engineer job in a small and fast team.
Here is my [resume]|[pdf version]|[LinkedIn]|[GitHub].
