**2014/12 - 2017/1, Maxwell DataCore Team**  

I made computation faster.  

* **Individually replaced computation engine by re-writing using Intel's Threading Building Blocks, reduced lines of code by 90%, achieving same performance and correctness**  
* **Optimized geophysical algorithms by using SSE2/AVX, performance improved by 20%**  
* Responsible for feature development, bug fixing and field support
* Performance profiling using Intel vTune and investigated performance bottleneck  
* Created fast instrumentation and tracing library to collect performance data during execution for C/C++  
* Mentored interns from Tsinghua HPC lab on performance optimization
* Refactored legacy code and added tests on code base of total lines of code > 20M


**2013/1 - 2014/12, Maxwell Environment Team**  

I made CI system distributed and run faster.  

*  Designed and implemented continuous integration system, aiming for distributed and cloud-based  
*  Introduced Pester as PowerShell unit test framework, hosted reading club & coding Dojos to help colleagues learn TDD & PowerShell  
*  Hosted various coding Dojos inside company, presented in internal workshops and events  


**2012/4 - 2012/12, Maxwell Platform & Performance Team**

*  Investigated logging using Event Tracing for Windows, to collect runtime information and better logging performance
*  Accelerated build performance with distributed compilation softwares  
*  Helped team as Scrum Master; hosted coding Dojos every week to improve TDD, OOAD skills, and to learn other programming languages  


**2011/8 - 2012/3, Maxwell DataPrep Team**

*  Developed & maintained Maxwell framework data processing component  
*  Developed Re-Compute Robot, to do both parallel & sequential computation base on same data set, for data validation & performance benchmark  


### **CYOU .Inc, [cyou.com](http://www.cyou.com), Game Developer, 2010 - 2011**

*  Feature development of item, family, ladder and PVP system
*  Improved font rending performance  
*  Implemented C# delegate style event system, supporting asynchronized method invocation
*  Created Lua script template for generic item operation
*  Developed game robot for pressure test, extensible via Lua
