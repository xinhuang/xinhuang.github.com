`Y Combinator`, where the name of the famous VC "Y Combinator", is a concept
from the lambda calculus. It is a very interesting concept proving that
recursion is not needed to build recursion.

Like C. P. Snow  used knowledge of the Second Law of Thermodynamics as a kind
of dividing line between those who were scientifically literate and those who
weren't, the `Y Combinator` can be used as the dividing line in computer science
between those who are "functionally literate" and who are not.
