In this article the author describes 10 common mistakes we might find in our daily work, e.g. engineering is more clever than business, in house "inventions", following the status quo. These mistakes are so common that even we are know them well, we cannot tell if we are commiting the same mistake sometime. Read this article will help us re-think our current projects, re-orgnize our engineering principles and (perhaps) build better products in the future.
