Braid is a very good game. The author gives a very good operation log on how to refactor an commercialized product. The refactoring covers topics like compiler upgrade, component upgrade, dead code clean up, logic simplification, etc. It's a bit long, but will be a interesting reading if you have done same thing before, or plan to do it in the future.
