[tmux](https://tmux.github.io) is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you switch
easily between several programs in one console. It is very usefull if you use
SSH a lot. And it is even cooler to allow you to detach and re-attach your sessions.

If you never tried it, jump to the "__related reading__" section. If you are using
vim with tmux, this post helps your vim and tmux better work together.
